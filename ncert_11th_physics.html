                        is called in motion. <br><br> It is a change in the position of an object over time. <br><br>

                    <dd>In physics, gravity (from Latin gravitas 'weight') is a fundamental interaction which causes
                        all things with mass or
                        energy to be attracted (or gravitate) toward one another. <br><br> Gravity is by far the weakest
                        of the
                        four fundamental
                        interactions, approximately 1038 times weaker than the strong interaction, 1036 times weaker
                        than the electromagnetic
                        force and 1029 times weaker than the weak interaction. As a result, it has no significant
                        influence at the level of
                        subatomic particles. <br><br> However, gravity is the most significant interaction between
                        objects at
                        the macroscopic scale,
                        and it determines the motion of planets, stars, galaxies, and even light. <br><br> For

                    <dd>A solid has definite shape and size. <br><br> In order to change (or
                        deform) the shape or size of a body, a force is required. <br><br> If
                        you stretch a helical spring by gently pulling its ends, the
                        length of the spring increases slightly. <br><br> When you leave the
                        ends of the spring, it regains its original size and shape. <br><br> The
                        property of a body, by virtue of which it tends to regain its
                        original size and shape when the applied force is removed, is
                        known as elasticity and the deformation caused is known
                        as elastic deformation. <br><br> However, if you apply force to a lump
                        of putty or mud, they have no gross tendency to regain their
                        previous shape, and they get permanently deformed. <br><br> Such
                        substances are called plastic and this property is called
                        plasticity. Putty and mud are close to ideal plastics. <br><br> For

                        thermodynamic behavior of
                        gases, with which many principal concepts of thermodynamics were established. <br><br> For

                    <dd>Oscillation is the repetitive or periodic variation, typically in time, of some measure about a
                        central value or between
                        two or more different states. <br><br> Familiar examples of oscillation include a swinging
                        pendulum and
                        alternating current. <br><br> For
