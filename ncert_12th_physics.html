                    <dd>Electric potential and capacitance stem from the concept of charge. The charge is the comparison
                        of the number of
                        protons and electrons a material possesses. <br> <br> If there are more protons than electrons,
                        then there is a net positive
                        charge. <br> <br> Conversely, if there are more electrons than protons, there is a net negative
                        charge. An equal number of protons
                        and electrons have a neutral charge. <br> <br> Materials with charge also exhibit electrical
                        forces: opposite charges attract
                        (e.g., positive and negative), and similar charges repel (e.g., positive and positive or
                        negative and negative). <br> <br>

                    <dd>Both Electricity and Magnetism have been known for more than 2000
                        years. <br><br> However, it was only about 200 years ago, in 1820, that it was
                        realised that they were intimately related*. <br><br> During a lecture demonstration
                        in the summer of 1820, the Danish physicist Hans Christian Oersted
                        noticed that a current in a straight wire caused a noticeable deflection in
                        a nearby magnetic compass needle. <br><br> He investigated this phenomenon.
                        He found that the alignment of the needle is tangential to an imaginary
                        circle which has the straight wire as its centre and has its plane
                        perpendicular to the wire.<br><br> It was
                        noted that when the current is large and the needle sufficiently close to
                        the wire so that the earth's magnetic field may be ignored. Reversing the
                        direction of the current reverses the orientation of the needle. <br><br>
                        The deflection increases on increasing the current or bringing the needle
                        closer to the wire. Iron filings sprinkled around the wire arrange
                        themselves in concentric circles with the wire as the centre. <br><br>
                        Oersted concluded that moving charges or currents produced a
                        magnetic field in the surrounding space. <br><br>

                        aluminum that are not normally thought of as having magnetic properties are affected by the
                        presence of a magnetic field
                        such as that produced by either pole of a bar magnet. <br><br> Depending on whether there is an
                        attraction or repulsion by the
                        pole of a magnet, matter is classified as being either paramagnetic or diamagnetic,
                        respectively. <br><br>

                    <dd>Electricity and magnetism were considered separate and unrelated
                        phenomena for a long time.<br><br> In the early decades of the nineteenth century,
                        experiments on electric current by Oersted, Ampere and a few others
                        established the fact that electricity and magnetism are inter-related. They
                        found that moving electric charges produce magnetic fields. <br><br> For example,
                        an electric current deflects a magnetic compass needle placed in its vicinity.
                        This naturally raises the questions like: Is the converse effect possible?
                        Can moving magnets produce electric currents? Does the nature permit
                        such a relation between electricity and magnetism? <br><br> The answer is
                        resounding yes! <br> The experiments of Michael Faraday in England and
                        Joseph Henry in USA, conducted around 1830, demonstrated
                        conclusively that electric currents were induced in closed coils when
                        subjected to changing magnetic fields. <br><br> Electromagnetic Induction and Alternating
                        Current are linked with each other, hence I have combined the notes of both the chapters, you

                    <dd>Atomic structure refers to the structure of an atom comprising a nucleus (centre) in which the
                        protons (positively
                        charged) and neutrons (neutral) are present. <br><br> The negatively charged particles called
                        electrons
                        revolve around the centre
                        of the nucleus. <br><br>
                        The history of atomic structure and quantum mechanics dates back to the times of Democritus, the
                        man who first proposed
                        that matter is composed of atoms.<br><br>

                    <dd>The atomic nucleus is the small, dense region consisting of protons and neutrons at the center
                        of an atom, discovered in
                        1911 by Ernest Rutherford based on the 1909 Geiger-Marsden gold foil experiment.<br><br>

                    <dd>A semiconductor material has an electrical conductivity value falling between that of a
                        conductor, such as metallic
                        copper, and an insulator, such as glass. <br><br> Its resistivity falls as its temperature rises; metals
                        behave in the opposite
                        way.<br><br>
